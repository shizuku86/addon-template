This repository is a template based on the specifications of the Kairo addon linked below.

After cloning, run the following command to install node_modules:

- npm install

After editing the lines ending with # in scripts/properties.ts appropriately and resolving errors,  
execute the following command in the terminal:

When this command is executed, the following operations will be performed:

- manifest.json is automatically generated in BP/ and RP/ from the information in properties
- TypeScript files in scripts/ are built as JavaScript into BP/scripts
- The pack_icon.png at the project root is copied into both BP/ and RP/
- The completed BP/ and RP/ are copied into Minecraft’s development folder

## Requirements
